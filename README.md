# Model Deployment using Flask on Heroku, with API Testing done in Postman

__This deliverable is focussed on deploying a ML model using the simple web-framework Flask. This model was then deployed onto Heroku, which is a Platform As A Service (PAAS). Once deployed, API testing was done using Postman, which is a simple tool that helps test APIs quickly and conveniently.__
